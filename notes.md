`(expr:_) <- getArgs` This is pattern matching on the list returned by getArgs. It extracts the first command-line argument (expr) and ignores the rest (_). If no arguments are given, it will crashâ€”so it's not safe without checks.

`>>` in Haskell is a sequencing operator used in monads. Its behavior depends on the monad: in the Parser monad, it runs the first parser, then the second on the remaining input, failing if either fails. In the IO monad, it runs actions in order, discarding the first result. Always check the monad's docs to understand its exact behavior.

In Haskell, `Either a b` represents a value that is either `Left a` (an error) or `Right b` (a success). You handle it with pattern matching:

```haskell
case result of  
  Left err   -> handle the error  
  Right val  -> use the successful value
```

Parsec uses `Left` for parse errors and `Right` for successful parses.

`>>` ("bind") operator, it was used behind the scenes to combine the lines of a do-block. Here, we use it explicitly to combine our whitespace and symbol parsers. However, bind has completely different semantics in the Parser and IO monads. In the Parser monad, bind means "Attempt to match the first parser, then attempt to match the second with the remaining input, and fail if either fails." In general, bind will have wildly different effects in different monads; it's intended as a general way to structure computations, and so needs to be general enough to accommodate all the different types of computations. Read the documentation for the monad to figure out precisely what it does.
