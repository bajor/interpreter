### `(expr:_) <- getArgs` This is pattern matching on the list returned by getArgs.

It extracts the first command-line argument (expr) and ignores the rest (_). If no arguments are given, it will crash—so it's not safe without checks.

### `>>` in Haskell is a sequencing operator used in monads.

Its behavior depends on the monad: in the Parser monad, it runs the first parser, then the second on the remaining input, failing if either fails. In the IO monad, it runs actions in order, discarding the first result. Always check the monad's docs to understand its exact behavior.
<br>
In general, use >> if the actions don't return a value, >>= if you'll be immediately passing that value into the next action, and do-notation otherwise.

### **`do`‑notation** is just syntactic sugar for chaining monadic operations with **`>>=`** (bind) and **`>>`** (sequence/discard). It lets you write “imperative‑looking” code while still living inside any monad.


| In `do`‑notation | Desugared form |
|------------------|----------------|
| `x <- m1`        | `m1 >>= \x -> …` (binds the result of `m1` to `x`) |
| `m1`             | `m1 >> …` (discard `m1`’s result and continue) |
| last line `e`    | `return e` (implicit) |

**How it plays out in different monads**

* **`IO`** – each line is an IO action executed in order.  
```haskell
do name <- getLine      -- wait for user input
 putStrLn ("Hi " ++ name)  -- then greet
```

### In Haskell, `Either a b` represents a value that is either `Left a` (an error) or `Right b` (a success). You handle it with pattern matching:

```haskell
case result of  
  Left err   -> handle the error  
  Right val  -> use the successful value
```

Parsec uses `Left` for parse errors and `Right` for successful parses.

### Function Application with `$`:
```haskell
-- Without $
print (sum (map (+1) [1,2,3]))

-- With $
print $ sum $ map (+1) [1,2,3]

-- Same result, less parentheses
```

<br>

---

<br>


### **(<|>)** tries the first, left option, if it fails, tries the right one
```haskell
-- Works with Maybe, Parsers, etc.

Just 1 <|> Just 2     -- Result: Just 1
Nothing <|> Just 2    -- Result: Just 2
-- Chained <|>: picks the first Just, skips the rest
Nothing <|> Nothing <|> Just 3 <|> Just 4  -- Result: Just 3
```

<br>

### In Haskell, both **function application ($) and function composition (.)** are **right-associative**. This makes it convenient to **read expressions from right to left** — from data to result.

- **Function Application ($)**: applies a function with low precedence, allowing fewer parentheses.
- **Function Composition (.)**: creates a new function by composing two or more functions.

<br>

Example 1: Using `$` to reduce parentheses
Instead of:
```haskell
  print (sum (map (+1) [1,2,3]))
```
You can write:
```haskell
  print $ sum $ map (+1) [1,2,3]
```
<br>

Example 2: Using `.` to compose functions
```haskell
  (f . g . h) x  ==  f (g (h x))
```
So:
```haskell
  map (negate . abs) [-1,2,-3] == [-1,-2,-3]
```
<br>

Example 3: Combined usage
```haskell
  print . sum . map (+1) $ [1,2,3]
```
Reads as: "map (+1), then sum, then print"

Reading right to left helps mentally model the **data flow**.

### `return` in Haskell and Monads

In Haskell, `return` is **not like return in other languages**. It does **not exit a function** — instead, it **wraps a value into a monad**.

Type:
```haskell
  return :: Monad m => a -> m a
```

It lifts a plain value into a monadic context.

Examples:

- `return 5 :: Maybe Int`    → `Just 5`
- `return "hi" :: IO String` → wraps into an IO action
- `return 42 :: Parser Int`  → parser that always returns 42 without consuming input

In `do` blocks:
```
  do
    x <- someAction
    return (f x)
```

Here, `return` is used to wrap the result so the entire block returns a monadic value.

Summary:
- `return` ≠ exit — it's a **monadic lift**
- It is essential for working inside monads like `IO`, `Maybe`, `Parser`, etc.
- Think of it as: _“Put this value into a box”_ (the monad)

Note: modern Haskell often uses `pure` (from `Applicative`) instead of `return`, but they are equivalent for most practical purposes.

### **`liftM`** is a function from `Control.Monad` that **lifts a normal (pure) function into a monadic context**.

Type:
```
  liftM :: Monad m => (a -> b) -> m a -> m b
```

It lets you apply a function to the result of a monadic computation, similar to `fmap`, but for any Monad (not just Functor).

<br>
Example:

Instead of writing:
```haskell
  do x <- action
     return (f x)
```

You can write:
```haskell
  liftM f action
```
